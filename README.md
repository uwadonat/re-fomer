# Reformer



## About The Project

In this project I Implemented the multiple ways to build a form in rails that can send parameters to a controller so that it can build an instance of a model with those parameters. I built our form using HTML, Form_tag and finally using Form_with.
I also added features for edit and delete record from database as optional.
